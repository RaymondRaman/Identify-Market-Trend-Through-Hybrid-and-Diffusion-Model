### Training Data Regimes (Revised Understanding):
- **Red**: Initial uptrend phase at lower price levels
- **Green**: Middle phase showing steady uptrend with moderate slope
- **Blue**: Steep acceleration phase leading to market peak (highest prices)
- **Purple**: Initial downtrend/correction after the peak
- **Yellow/Orange**: What appears to be the beginning of a new uptrend after the correction phase

### Testing Data Regimes:
- **Yellow/Orange (State 4)**: Continuous uptrend from January 2023 to January 2024 ($14 to $50)

### Consistency Reassessment:
If we view the training and testing data as a continuous timeline, the yellow/orange regime at the end of the training period could indeed represent the beginning of the same uptrend that continues throughout the testing period.
