### Training Data Regimes:
- **Red** (earliest phase): Initial gradual uptrend at lower price levels 
- **Purple**: Steeper uptrend phase to mid-range prices
- **Green**: Middle phase showing fluctuations and moderate uptrend behavior
- **Blue**: Later phase showing steep acceleration to highest prices
- **Yellow/Orange**: Final phase showing market peak and subsequent correction/downtrend

### Testing Data Regimes:
- **Green (State 1)**: Applied to lower price ranges ($290-450), appearing during:
  * January-May 2023 at lower levels ($290-350)
  * May-July 2023 mid-range prices ($350-450)
- **Blue (State 0)**: Applied to higher price ranges ($370-500), appearing during:
  * August 2023-January 2024, capturing the final uptrend to highest prices

### Consistency Assessment:
The model maintains clear consistency in how regimes are applied between datasets:
- **Blue** consistently represents higher price ranges in both datasets
- **Green** consistently represents lower/middle price ranges in both datasets
- The model effectively distinguishes between price levels rather than exclusively focusing on trend direction
