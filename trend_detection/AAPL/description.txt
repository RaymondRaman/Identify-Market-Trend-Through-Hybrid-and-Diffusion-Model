### Failure: The best model trained but still fails to detect market regimes

### Training Data Regimes:
- **Green**: Initial phase showing consistent uptrend at lower price levels (earliest period)
- **Yellow/Orange**: Brief appearance during a sharp correction phase (likely COVID crash)
- **Green (again)**: Recovery phase following correction
- **Purple**: Middle uptrend phase as prices continue climbing
- **Red**: Later uptrend phase, capturing the steepest price increases
- **Blue**: Final phase showing market peak and subsequent downtrend/correction

### Testing Data Regimes:
- **Blue (State 0)**: Used for the initial phase from January through March 2023, showing uptrend from ~$130 to ~$160
- **Red (State 2)**: Dominates from April 2023 to January 2024, covering:
  * Continued uptrend from ~$160 to ~$195 (April-July)
  * Downtrend/correction from ~$195 to ~$170 (August-October)
  * Recovery/uptrend from ~$170 back to ~$195 (November-December)
- **Green (State 1)** and **Purple (State 3)**: Appear only briefly at the beginning of the period

### Consistency Assessment:
There are clear inconsistencies in how regimes are applied between datasets:
- In training data, blue represents market peak and downtrend
- In testing data, blue represents uptrend
- Similarly, red represents only uptrend in training but both uptrend AND downtrend in testing
