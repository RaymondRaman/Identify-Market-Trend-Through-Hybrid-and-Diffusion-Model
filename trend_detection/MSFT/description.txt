### Training Data Regimes:
- **Blue** (earliest phase): Initial gradual uptrend phase
- **Purple** (middle phase): Continued steady uptrend period
- **Red** (later phase): Accelerating uptrend leading to peak
- **Green** (final phase): Market peak and subsequent downtrend/correction

### Testing Data Regimes:
- **Purple (State 3)**: Dominates almost the entire testing period from January 2023 to January 2024, capturing the consistent uptrend from ~$220 to ~$380
- **Blue (State 0)**: Appears only as a single data point at the beginning of January 2023

### Consistency Assessment:
The model maintains consistency in how it applies the purple regime between training and testing data:
- In both datasets, purple clearly represents a steady uptrend phase
- The testing period is predominantly characterized by a consistent uptrend throughout 2023, which the model correctly identifies with a single regime (purple)
- The model avoids artificially dividing the testing period into multiple regimes when the overall market behavior remains consistent
