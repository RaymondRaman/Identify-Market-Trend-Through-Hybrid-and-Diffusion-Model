### Training Data Regimes:
- **Red**: Early phase showing relatively flat/sideways movement with some mild fluctuations
- **Green**: Middle phase capturing a consistent, steady uptrend period
- **Purple**: Brief appearance during steeper uptrend acceleration
- **Blue**: Final phase showing market peak and subsequent downtrend

### Testing Data Regimes:
- **Green (State 1)**: Dominates almost the entire testing period from January 2023 to January 2024, capturing the consistent uptrend from ~$85 to ~$140+
- **Red (State 2)**: Appears only in a single data point near the beginning of January 2023

### Consistency Assessment:
- In the training data, green clearly represents a steady uptrend phase
- In the testing data, green is similarly used to identify the uptrend that characterizes almost the entire 2023 period
- The model consistently applies the green regime to uptrend periods across both datasets
