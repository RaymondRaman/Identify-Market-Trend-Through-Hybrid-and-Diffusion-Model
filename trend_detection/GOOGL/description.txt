## **Analysis**

### **Training Data (Second Image):**
- The training visualization shows multiple regimes:
  - **Blue (State 0)**: Represents early consolidation and lower price ranges.
  - **Red (State 2)**: Captures steady uptrend phases similar to the testing data.
  - **Green (State 1)**: Identifies peak periods and higher price ranges.
  - **Purple (State 3)**: Appears during high volatility or correction phases.

### **Testing Data (First Image):**
- The testing visualization shows the entire 2023-2024 period classified as **State 2 (red)**.
- This classification is reasonable because:
  - The testing period spans a consistent uptrend phase, with prices rising from ~$85 in January 2023 to ~$140 in January 2024.
  - There are no major market corrections or volatility shifts during this time that would require the identification of additional regimes.
