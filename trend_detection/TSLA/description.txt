### Training Data Regimes:
- **Yellow/Orange**: Initial uptrend at lowest price levels ($30-60)
- **Purple**: Continued uptrend at moderate price levels ($60-100) 
- **Blue**: Middle phase showing mixed behavior with uptrends and volatility ($100-300)
- **Green**: Steep acceleration phase leading to market peak ($300-400+)
- **Red**: Final phase showing significant downtrend/correction ($400 down to ~$100)

### Testing Data Regimes:
- **Purple (State 3)**: Used for January through June 2023, capturing:
  * Lower price range ($110-275)
  * Initial uptrend from lowest points
  * Various fluctuations within this lower band
- **Blue (State 0)**: Used for July 2023 through January 2024, capturing:
  * Higher price range ($225-290)
  * Peak around $290 followed by significant volatility
  * Both rallies and pullbacks within this range

### Consistency Assessment:
The model maintains reasonable consistency in how regimes are applied between datasets:
- **Purple** consistently represents lower price ranges with uptrend characteristics
- **Blue** consistently represents higher price ranges with greater volatility
